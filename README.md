# jsix-image-format
JSIX: A custom experimental image file format that stores pixel data in hexadecimal.

I saw a video of someone creating their own image file format, so I decided to do the same with Python.

# Reasons to use the JSIX image format
- Your image files will be insanely large... (a 180 KB PNG can easily get up to 230 MB...)
- You won't be able to view your images with any image viewer other than the one provided in this repo.

# Conclusion
Maybe don't use it... 

I might add compression and other optimizations to make it smaller in the future.
